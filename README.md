# Presto.it

An online e-commerce website that allows users to register and publish commercial adverts. Users can create adverts to buy and sell several kind of goods, searching in a variety of different categories. Registered users can ask to collaborate with the management team, using a dedicated panel to review created adverts and avoid any inappropriate contents. This is also possible due a Google Algorithm that can analyze and check pictures to see if they infringe any community standards: inappropriate pictures will be automatically flagged and adverts won't be published on the website. This project has been developed using Bootstrap libraries, Laravel - The PHP Framework For Web Artisans, and some sprinkles of Livewire and JavaScript. This small project enables you to:

-   Create, edit, and delete commercial adverts.
-   Possibility to join the staff team and monitor all the new adverts, making sure they aren't going to infringe any community standards, with a dedicated panel.
-   Manage users and assign them roles.
